					  <p>Twitter demo that uses the <a href="https://github.com/twitter/hbc">Streaming API from Twitter</a> and tracks these terms

					  <p>
					  Simplified copy of the <a href="https://github.com/bijukunjummen/si-spring-websockets">si-spring-websockets application</a>. This demo does not
					  use Spring Integration and RabbitMQ. Instead the polling to earthquake.usgs.gov is done with a simple scheduled spring bean method and the last
					  result is stored in memory.

					  <strong><a class="demolink" href="echatdemo/index.html">Chat with WebRTC</a></strong>
					  <p>
					  An enhanced chat application with WebRTC.
					  <br>
					  To start a WebRTC connection there need to be two users connected to the chat. In Chrome you could also start two browser instances
					  and connect with two different names to the chat.  
					  <br>
					  Then one user selectes the other user. If both clients are WebRTC capable the button "Start Peer-to-Peer Connection" becomes enabled.
					  If everything goes right you should see your video on the left and the video from the other user on the right side.<br>  
					  The SDP and ICE messages between the two peers are exchanged with WAMP. As soon as the connection is established it's a peer to peer connection that 
					  no longer needs a server. For more information about WebRTC see the article on <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/">html5rocks</a>.
					  <br>
					  The peer-to-peer part should also work over the internet even if both users are behind a NAT/Firewall. The application uses a STUN server (stun.stunprotocol.org) for external ip and port discovery.
					  But it may not work everywhere and everytime. When NAT 'hole punching' fails it needs a TURN server to relay the traffic, but I haven't found a free and public available 
					  TURN server that I could use for this demo.
